 abstract = {In this paper, a new memetic algorithm (MA) is proposed for the muti-objective flexible job shop scheduling problem (MO-FJSP) with the objectives to minimize the makespan, total workload and critical workload. By using well-designed chromosome encoding/decoding scheme and genetic operators, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is first adapted for the MO-FJSP. Then the MA is developed by incorporating a novel local search algorithm into the adapted NSGA-II, where several mechanisms to balance the genetic search and local search are employed. In the proposed local search, a hierarchical strategy is adopted to handle the three objectives, which mainly considers the minimization of makespan, while the concern of the other two objectives is reflected in the order of trying all the possible actions that could generate the acceptable neighbor. Experimental results on well-known benchmark instances show that the proposed MA outperforms significantly two off-the-shelf multi-objective evolutionary algorithms and four state-of-the-art algorithms specially proposed for the MO-FJSP.},
