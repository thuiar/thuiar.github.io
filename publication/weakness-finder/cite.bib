 abstract = {Finding the weakness of the products from the customers’ feedback can help manufacturers improve their product quality and competitive strength. In recent years, more and more people express their opinions about products online, and both the feedback of manufacturers’ products or their competitors’ products could be easily collected. However, it’s impossible for manufacturers to read every review to analyze the weakness of their products. Therefore, finding product weakness from online reviews becomes a meaningful work. In this paper, we introduce such an expert system, Weakness Finder, which can help manufacturers find their product weakness from Chinese reviews by using aspects based sentiment analysis. An aspect is an attribute or component of a product, such as price, degerm, moisturizing are the aspects of the body wash products. Weakness Finder extracts the features and groups explicit features by using morpheme based method and Hownet based similarity measure, and identify and group the implicit features with collocation selection method for each aspect. Then utilize sentence based sentiment analysis method to determine the polarity of each aspect in sentences. The weakness of product could be found because the weakness is probably the most unsatisfied aspect in customers’ reviews, or the aspect which is more unsatisfied when compared with their competitor’s product reviews. Weakness Finder has been used to help a body wash manufacturer find their product weakness, and our experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the Weakness Finder.},
