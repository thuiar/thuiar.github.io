 abstract = {Pittsburgh-style learning classifier systems (LCSs), in which an entire candidate solution is represented as a set of variable number of rules, combine supervised learning with genetic algorithms (GAs) to evolve rule-based classification models. It has been shown that standard crossover operators in GAs do not guarantee an effective evolutionary search in many sophisticated problems that contain strong interactions between features. In this paper, we propose a Pittsburgh-style learning classifier system based on the Bayesian optimization algorithm with the aim of improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the rule structure exploration. In the proposed method, classifiers are generated and recombined at two levels. At the lower level, single rules contained in classifiers are produced by sampling Bayesian networks which characterize the global statistical information extracted from the current promising rules in the search space. At the higher level, classifiers are recombined by rule-wise uniform crossover operators to keep the semantics of rules in each classifier. Experimental studies on both artificial and real world binary classification problems show that the proposed method converges faster while achieving solutions with the same or even higher accuracy compared with the original Pittsburgh-style LCSs.},
