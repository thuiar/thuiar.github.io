research on Facial Expression Recognition (FER) assisted by facial landmarks mainly focused on single-task learning or hard-parameter sharing based multi-task learning. However, soft-parameter shar- ing based methods have not been explored in this area. Therefore, this paper adopts Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) as the auxiliary task and explores new multi-task learning strategies for FER. First, three classical multi-task structures, including Hard-Parameter Sharing (HPS), Cross-Stitch Network (CSN), and Partially Shared Multi-task Convolutional Neural Network (PS-MCNN), are used to verify the advantages of multi-task learning for FER. Then, we propose a new end-to-end Co-attentive Multi-task Convolutional Neural Network (CMCNN), which is composed of the Channel Co-Attention Module (CCAM) and the Spa- tial Co-Attention Module (SCAM). Functionally, the CCAM generates the channel co-attention scores by capturing the inter-dependencies of different channels between FER and FLD tasks. The SCAM combines the max- and average-pooling operations to formulate the spatial co-attention scores. Finally, we con- duct extensive experiments on four widely used benchmark facial expression databases, including RAF, SFEW2, CK+, and Oulu-CASIA. Extensive experimental results show that our approach achieves better performance than single-task and multi-task baselines, fully validating multi-task learning s effectiveness and generalizability.","tags":[],"title":"Co-attentive multi-task convolutional neural network for facial expression recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["袁子麒","WeiLi","徐华","余文梦"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1634718244,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1634718244,"objectID":"dcb19b7e0d77ae162f602fb808c04194","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/zh/publication/transformer-based-feature-reconstruction-network-for-robust-multimodal-sentiment-analysis/","publishdate":"2021-10-20T16:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/transformer-based-feature-reconstruction-network-for-robust-multimodal-sentiment-analysis/","section":"publication","summary":"Improving robustness against data missing has become one of the core challenges in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), which aims to judge speaker sentiments from the language, visual, and acoustic signals. In the current research, translation-based methods and tensor regularization methods are proposed for MSA with incomplete modality features. However, both of them fail to cope with random modality feature missing in non-aligned sequences. In this paper, a transformer-based feature reconstruction network (TFR-Net) is proposed to improve the robustness of models for the random missing in non-aligned modality sequences. First, intramodal and inter-modal attention-based extractors are adopted to learn robust representations for each element in modality sequences. Then, a reconstruction module is proposed to generate the missing modality features. With the supervision of SmoothL1Loss between generated and complete sequences, TFR-Net is expected to learn semantic-level features corresponding to missing features. Extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets show that our model achieves good results against data missing across various missing modality combinations and various missing degrees.","tags":[],"title":"Transformer-based Feature Reconstruction Network for Robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["张瀚镭","李晓腾","徐华","PanpanZhang","赵康","KaiGao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1620462244,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1620462244,"objectID":"e506f9d300b6b691d19ea82504a0d692","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/zh/publication/textoir/","publishdate":"2021-05-08T16:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/textoir/","section":"publication","summary":"TEXTOIR is the first integrated and visualized platform for text open intent recognition.

However, few existing works consider possible relations information between entities before extracting them, which may lead to the fact that most of the extracted entities cannot constitute valid triples. In this paper, we propose a representation iterative fusion based on heterogeneous graph neural networks for relation extraction (RIFRE).

To address this problem, we propose to maintain the desired diversity of solutions in their evolutionary process explicitly by exploiting the perpendicular distance from the solution to the weight vector in the objective space, which achieves better balance between convergence and diversity in many-objective optimization. The idea is implemented to enhance two well-performing decomposition-based algorithms, i.e., MOEA, based on decomposition and ensemble fitness ranking.

Much recent research in short text becomes increasingly significant, such as topic inference for short text. Biterm topic model (BTM) benefits from the word co-occurrence patterns of the corpus, which makes it perform better than conventional topic models in uncovering latent semantic relevance for short text. However, BTM resorts to Gibbs sampling to infer topics, which is very time consuming, especially for large-scale datasets or when the number of topics is extremely large. It requires O(K) operations per sample for K topics, where K denotes the number of topics in the corpus. In this paper, we propose an acceleration algorithm of BTM, FastBTM, using an efficient sampling method for BTM, which converges much faster than BTM without degrading topic quality. FastBTM is based on Metropolis-Hastings and alias method, both of which have been widely adopted in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and achieved outstanding speedup. Our FastBTM can effectively reduce the sampling complexity of biterm topic model from O(K) to O(1) amortized time. We carry out a number of experiments on three datasets including two short text datasets, Tweets2011 Collection dataset and Yahoo! Answers dataset, and one long document dataset, Enron dataset. Our experimental results show that when the number of topics K increases, the gap in running time speed between FastBTM and BTM gets especially larger.

Our method classifies examples that differ from known intents as unknown and does not require any examples or prior knowledge of it.

The service has gained worldwide popularity since it was created in March 2006, with more than 316 million monthly active users in June 2015 who posted 500 million tweets per day. As the number of available tweets grows, the problem of managing tweets becomes extremely difficult, which could lead to information overload. To avoid this problem, people use the hashtag symbol # before a relevant keyword or phrase in their tweets to categorize those tweets and help them show more easily in each Twitter search. Furthermore, hashtags can be used to collect public opinions on events and their ideas at the individual, community or even the world level. Incorporating hashtags to obtain better performance such as sentiment classification and breaking events detection also has attracted considerable research attention in recent years. However, there are very few tweets containing hashtags, which impedes the quality of search results and their further usage in various applications. Therefore, hashtag recommendation has become a particularly important research problem. In this paper, we first propose a novel model, namely online Twitter-User LDA to learn Twitter users’ dynamic interests. Then considering the shortness, sparsity, and high volume of tweets, we introduce an effective method to discover the latent topics of streaming tweet content, which uses recently proposed incremental biterm topic model (IBTM). We finally design an automatic hashtag recommendation method called User-IBTM by combining the online Twitter-User LDA and IBTM. As shown in the experimental results on real world data from Twitter, our design method based on dynamic user interests and streaming tweet content significantly outperforms several other baseline methods and can suggest more precise hashtags.","tags":[],"title":"Suggest what to tag: Recommending more precise hashtags based on users’ dynamic interests and streaming tweet content","type":"publication"},{"authors":["WenhaoZhang","JianqiuJi","JunZhu","JianminLi","徐华","BoZhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1600522718,"objectID":"ca2321ef330a70a051b1971c748ae7ae","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/zh/publication/bithash/","publishdate":"2020-09-19T13:38:37.383344Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/bithash/","section":"publication","summary":"Locality Sensitive Hashing has been applied to detecting near-duplicate images, videos and web documents.

We think that based on the explicit synonymous feature group and the sentences which contain explicit features, several Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers can be established to classify the non-explicit sentences. Nevertheless, instead of simply using traditional feature selection methods, we believe an explicit topic model in which each topic is pre-defined could perform better. In this paper, we first extend a popular topic modeling method, called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to construct an explicit topic model. Then some types of prior knowledge, such as: must-links, cannot-links and relevance-based prior knowledge, are extracted and incorporated into the explicit topic model automatically.

This is mainly due to the fact that the selection pressure based on Pareto-dominance degrades severely with the number of objectives increasing. Very recently, a reference-point based NSGA-II, referred as NSGA-III, is suggested to deal with many-objective problems, where the maintenance of diversity among population members is aided by supplying and adaptively updating a number of well-spread reference points. However, NSGA-III still relies on Pareto-dominance to push the population towards Pareto front (PF), leaving room for the improvement of its convergence ability. In this paper, an improved NSGA-III procedure, called 牟-NSGA-III, is proposed, aiming to better tradeoff the convergence and diversity in many-objective optimization. In 牟-NSGA-III, the non-dominated sorting scheme based on the proposed 牟-dominance is employed to rank solutions in the environmental selection phase, which ensures both convergence and diversity.

Two sets of features have been extracted: count based features and content based features. For the former, the information in the aspect of users, which decrease the influence of garbage microblogs, has been exploited. For content based features, a new box office oriented semantic classification method has been provided to make the features more relative with box offices. Meanwhile, more complex machine learning models such as SVM and neutral network have been applied to the prediction method. Our prediction model is more accurate and reliable. With our prediction method, the data in Tencent microblog has been utilized to predict box offices of certain movies in China.

On one hand, the number of topics is fixed as a priori, but in real world, it is input by the users. On the other hand, it ignores the hierarchical information of topics and cannot grow structurally as more data are observed. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised hierarchical topic model, which aims to explore more reasonable topics in the data space by incorporating some constraints into the modeling process that are extracted automatically. The new method is denoted as constrained hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (constrained-hLDA).

Microblogging, one of the most popular social network applications that allows people to share ideas and discuss over various topics, is taken as a rich resource of opinion and emotion data. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel method for identifying emotions in microblog posts. Unlike traditional approaches which are mostly based on statistical methods, we try to infer and extract the reasons of emotions by importing knowledge and theories from other fields such as Sociology. Based on the theory that a triggering cause event is an integral part of emotion, the technique of emotion cause extraction is used as a crucial step to improve the quality of selected features. First, after thorough analysis on sample data we constructed an automatic rule-based system to detect and extract the cause event of each emotional post. We build an emotion corpus with Chinese microblog posts labeled by human annotators. Then a classifier is trained to classify emotions in microblog posts based on extracted cause events. The overall performance of our system is very promising. The experiment results show that our approach is effective in selecting informative features. Our system outperformed the baseline noticeably in most cases, suggesting its great potential. This exploration should provide a new way to look at the emotion classification task and lay the ground for future research on textual emotion processing.","tags":["\"Emotion classification\"","\"Emotion cause extraction\"","\"Microblogging\"","\"Weibo\""],"title":"Text-based emotion classification using emotion cause extraction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["WeiWang","徐华","Xiaoqiu Huang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1380585600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1600523746,"objectID":"19ba18be40238c84b2af736b7ef526bc","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/zh/publication/implicit-feature-detection-via-a-constrained-topic-model-and-svm/","publishdate":"2020-09-19T13:55:45.407589Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/implicit-feature-detection-via-a-constrained-topic-model-and-svm/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Implicit Feature Detection via a Constrained Topic Model and SVM","type":"publication"},{"authors":["袁源","徐华","杨甲东"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1600522723,"objectID":"46c5262473bbe0d43c6d815a83c10361","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/zh/publication/a-hybrid-harmony-search-algorithm-for-the-flexible-job-shop-scheduling-problem/","publishdate":"2020-09-19T13:38:42.870343Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/a-hybrid-harmony-search-algorithm-for-the-flexible-job-shop-scheduling-problem/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, a novel hybrid harmony search (HHS) algorithm based on the integrated approach, is proposed for solving the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) with the criterion to minimize makespan.

It has been shown that standard recombination operators in EAs do not assure an effective evolutionary search to solve sophisticated problems that contain strong interactions between features. On the other hand, when dealing with real-world classification tasks, irrelevant features not only complicate the problem but also incur unnecessary matchings in GBML systems, which increase the computational cost a lot. To handle the two problems mentioned above in an integrated manner, a new Pittsburgh-style GBML system is proposed. In the proposed method, classifiers are generated and recombined at two levels. At the high level, classifiers are recombined by rule-wise uniform crossover operators since each classifier consists of a variable-size rule set. At the low level, single rules contained in classifiers are reproduced via sampling Bayesian networks that characterize the global statistical information extracted from promising rules found so far. Furthermore, according to the statistical information in the rule population, an embedded approach is presented to detect and remove redundant features incrementally following the evolution of rule population. Results of empirical evaluation show that the proposed method outperforms the original Pittsburgh-style GBML system in terms of classification accuracy while reducing the computational cost. Furthermore, the proposed method is also competitive to other non-evolutionary, highly used machine learning methods.

Previous related research mainly relied on explicit features but ignored implicit features. However, the implicit features, which are implied by some words or phrases, are so significant that they can express the users’ opinion and help us to better understand the users’ comments. It is a big challenge to detect these implicit features in Chinese product reviews, due to the complexity of Chinese. This paper is mainly centered on implicit features identification in Chinese product reviews. A novel hybrid association rule mining method is proposed for this task. The core idea of this approach is mining as many association rules as possible via several complementary algorithms. Firstly, we extract candidate feature indicators based word segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging and feature clustering, then compute the co-occurrence degree between the candidate feature indicators and the feature words using five collocation extraction algorithms. Each indicator and the corresponding feature word constitute a rule (feature indicator → feature word). The best rules in five different rule sets are chosen as the basic rules. Next, three methods are proposed to mine some possible reasonable rules from the lower co-occurrence feature indicators and non indicator words. Finally, the latest rules are used to identify implicit features and the results are compared with the previous. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed approach is competent at the task, especially via using several expanding methods. The recall is effectively improved, suggesting that the shortcomings of the basic rules have been overcome to certain extent. Besides those high co-occurrence degree indicators, the final rules also contain uncommon rules.","tags":["\"Opinion mining\"","\"Implicit features\"","\"Hybrid association rule mining\"","\"Collocation extraction\""],"title":"Implicit feature identification via hybrid association rule mining","type":"publication"},{"authors":["徐华"],"categories":null,"content":"课程类型：清华大学公选课\n主讲教师：徐华\n授课对象：全校本科生、研究生\n授课时间：2013 - 今\n","date":1356969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1356969600,"objectID":"e7d4ecfaf4b1f29cd65dd9ec01f1f6ad","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/zh/talk/industrial-data-mining/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/zh/talk/industrial-data-mining/","section":"talk","summary":"清华大学公选课","tags":[],"title":"《工业数据挖掘》","type":"talk"},{"authors":["杨甲东","徐华","PeifaJia"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1600522727,"objectID":"f75a908859cf123bb5152d3a7c4fe155","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/zh/publication/effective-search-for-pittsburgh-learning-classifier-systems-via-estimation-of-distribution-algorithms/","publishdate":"2020-09-19T13:38:46.367342Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/effective-search-for-pittsburgh-learning-classifier-systems-via-estimation-of-distribution-algorithms/","section":"publication","summary":"Pittsburgh-style learning classifier systems (LCSs), in which an entire candidate solution is represented as a set of variable number of rules, combine supervised learning with genetic algorithms (GAs) to evolve rule-based classification models.

An aspect is an attribute or component of a product, such as price, degerm, moisturizing are the aspects of the body wash products. Weakness Finder extracts the features and groups explicit features by using morpheme based method and Hownet based similarity measure, and identify and group the implicit features with collocation selection method for each aspect. Then utilize sentence based sentiment analysis method to determine the polarity of each aspect in sentences. The weakness of product could be found because the weakness is probably the most unsatisfied aspect in customers’ reviews, or the aspect which is more unsatisfied when compared with their competitor’s product reviews.

Third, the proposed algorithm restricts the use of GA to evolve the task-processor mapping solutions, while taking advantage of an upward-ranking heuristic mostly used by traditional list scheduling approaches to determine the task sequence assignment in each processor. Empirical results on benchmark task graphs of several well-known parallel applications, which have been validated by the use of non-parametric statistical tests, show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms several related algorithms in terms of the schedule quality.

Classic methods for solving this problem are based on unsupervised learning using some forms of distributional similarity. However, we found that these methods do not do well. We then model it as a semi-supervised learning problem. Lexical characteristics of the problem are exploited to automatically identify some labeled examples. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.","tags":["\"product feature grouping\"","\"opinion mining\""],"title":"Clustering Product Features for Opinion Mining","type":"publication"},{"authors":["ZhongwuZhai","BingLiu","徐华","PeifaJia"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1600523749,"objectID":"8045747747311ac63a85201fbab02533","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/zh/publication/constrained-lda-for-grouping-product-features-in-opinion-mining/","publishdate":"2020-09-19T13:55:48.426867Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/constrained-lda-for-grouping-product-features-in-opinion-mining/","section":"publication","summary":"In opinion mining of product reviews, one often wants to produce a summary of opinions based on product features. However, for the same feature, people can express it with different words and phrases. To produce an effective summary, these words and phrases, which are domain synonyms, need to be grouped under the same feature. Topic modeling is a suitable method for the task. However, instead of simply letting topic modeling find groupings freely, we believe it is possible to do better by giving it some pre-existing knowledge in the form of automatically extracted constraints. In this paper, we first extend a popular topic modeling method, called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), with the ability to process large scale constraints. Then, two novel methods are proposed to extract two types of constraints automatically. Finally, the resulting constrained-LDA and the extracted constraints are applied to group product features. Experiments show that constrained-LDA outperforms the original LDA and the latest mLSA by a large margin.","tags":[],"title":"Constrained LDA for Grouping Product Features in Opinion Mining","type":"publication"},{"authors":["ZhongwuZhai","徐华","BadaKang","PeifaJia"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1600522730,"objectID":"d36c5e5a1ea50571022a176b086059bf","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/zh/publication/exploiting-effective-features-for-chinese-sentiment-classification/","publishdate":"2020-09-19T13:38:49.919342Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/exploiting-effective-features-for-chinese-sentiment-classification/","section":"publication","summary":"Features play a fundamental role in sentiment classification. How to effectively select different types of features to improve sentiment classification performance is the primary topic of this paper. Ngram features are commonly employed in text classification tasks; in this paper, sentiment-words, substrings, substring-groups, and key-substring-groups, which have never been considered in sentiment classification area before, are also extracted as features. The extracted features are then compared and analyzed. To demonstrate generality, we use two authoritative Chinese data sets in different domains to conduct our experiments. Our statistical analysis of the experimental results indicate the following: (1) different types of features possess different discriminative capabilities in Chinese sentiment classification; (2) character bigram features perform the best among the Ngram features; (3) substring-group features have greater potential to improve the performance of sentiment classification by combining substrings of different lengths; (4) sentiment words or phrases extracted from existing sentiment lexicons are not effective for sentiment classification; (5) effective features are usually at varying lengths rather than fixed lengths.","tags":["\"Sentiment classification\"","\"Substring features\"","\"Substring-group\"","\"Suffix tree\""],"title":"Exploiting effective features for Chinese sentiment classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["ZhongwuZhai","BingLiu","LeiZhang","徐华","PeifaJia"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1600523748,"objectID":"dc94ebc0f2c13a4d42abbfe0640ccf11","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/zh/publication/identifying-evaluative-sentences-in-online-discussions/","publishdate":"2020-09-19T13:55:47.457403Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/identifying-evaluative-sentences-in-online-discussions/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Identifying Evaluative Sentences in Online Discussions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["万伟","徐华","WenhaoZhang","XinchengHu","GangDeng"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1600522727,"objectID":"6a0bd186488f3ae758f71e2d65b97a67","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/zh/publication/questionnaires-based-skin-attribute-prediction-using-elman-neural-network/","publishdate":"2020-09-19T13:38:47.128344Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/questionnaires-based-skin-attribute-prediction-using-elman-neural-network/","section":"publication","summary":"Skin attribute tests, especially for women, have become critical in the development of daily cosmetics in recent years.

The prediction engine, which is the most important part of this novel approach, is composed of three prediction models. Each of these models is a neural network allocated to predict different skin attributes: Tone, Spots, and Hydration. We also provide a detailed analysis and solution about the preprocessing of data, the selection of key features, and the evaluation of results.

First, according to the task graph of multiprocessor scheduling problems, Bayesian networks are initialized and learned to capture the dependencies between different tasks. And the promising solutions assigning tasks to different processors are generated by sampling the Bayesian network. Second, the execution sequence of tasks on the same processor is set by the heuristic-based priority used in the list scheduling approach. The proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared with the related approaches by means of the empirical studies on random task graphs and benchmark applications. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to deliver more efficient schedules.

In this paper, a heuristic-based hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed for solving the heterogeneous multiprocessor scheduling problem. The proposed algorithm extends traditional GA-based approaches in three aspects. First, it incorporates GA with Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS), a local search metaheuristic, to enhance the balance between global exploration and local exploitation of search space. Second, two novel neighborhood structures, in which problem-specific knowledge concerned with load balancing and communication reduction is utilized, are proposed to improve both the search quality and efficiency of VNS. Third, the use of GA is restricted to map tasks to processors while an upward-ranking heuristic is introduced to determine the task sequence assignment in each processor. Simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithm consistently outperforms several state-of-art scheduling algorithms in terms of the schedule quality while maintaining high performance within a wide range of parameter settings.
