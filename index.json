natural interaction ability between human and machine mainly involves human-machine dialogue ability, multi-modal sentiment analysis ability, human-machine cooperation ability and so on. In order to realize the multi-modal sentiment analysis ability of intelligent computer, it is necessary to make the computer own strong multi-modal sentiment analysis ability in the process of human-computer interaction. This is one of the key technologies to realize efficient and intelligent human-computer interaction. The research and practical application of multi-modal sentiment analysis oriented to human-computer natural interaction, this book mainly discusses the following levels of hot research content: Multi-modal Information Feature Representation, Feature Fusion and Sentiment Classification. Multi-modal sentiment analysis oriented to natural interaction is a comprehensive research field involving the integration of natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning, pattern recognition, algorithm, robot intelligent system, human-computer interaction, etc. In recent years, our research team from State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, has conducted a lot of pioneering research and applied work, which have been carried out in the field of multi-modal sentiment analysis for natural interaction, especially in the field of sentiment feature representation, feature fusion, robust sentiment analysis based on deep learning model.

paper presents Adaptive Batch-ParEGO, an adaptive batch Bayesian optimization method for expensive multi-objective problems. This method extends the classical multi-objective Bayesian optimization method, sequential ParEGO, to the batch mode. Specifically, the proposed method exploits a newly proposed bi-objective acquisition func- tion to recommend and evaluate multiple solutions. The bi-objective acquisition function takes exploitation and exploration as two optimization objectives, which are traded off by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Since there’s usually a certain number of lim- ited hardware resources available in reality, we further propose an adaptive solution selec- tion criterion to fix the number of candidate solutions in each iteration. This strategy dynamically balances exploitation and exploration by tuning the hyper-parameter in the exploitation-exploration fitness function. In addition, the expected improvement is exploited to select another candidate solution to ensure convergence and make the algo- rithm more robust. We verify the effectiveness of Adaptive Batch-ParEGO on three multi-objective benchmarks and a hyperparameter tuning task of neural networks com- pared with the state-of-the-art multi-objective approaches. Our analysis demonstrates that the bi-objective acquisition function with the adaptive recommendation strategy can bal- ance exploitation and exploration well in batch mode for expensive multi-objective prob- lems.

However, existing re- searches observe that the acoustic and visual modalities contribute much less than the textual modality, termed as text-predominant. Under such circumstances, in this work, we emphasize making non-verbal cues matter for the MSA task. Firstly, from the resource perspective, we present the CH-SIMS v2.0 dataset, an extension and enhancement of the CH-SIMS. Compared with the original dataset, the CH-SIMS v2.0 doubles its size with another 2121 refined video segments containing both unimodal and multimodal annotations and collects 10161 unlabelled raw video segments with rich acoustic and visual emotion-bearing context to highlight non-verbal cues for sentiment prediction. Secondly, from the model perspective, bene- fiting from the unimodal annotations and the unsupervised data in the CH-SIMS v2.0, the Acoustic Visual Mixup Consistent (AV-MC) framework is proposed. The designed modality mixup module can be regarded as an augmentation, which mixes the acoustic and vi- sual modalities from different videos. Through drawing unobserved multimodal context along with the text, the model can learn to be aware of different non-verbal contexts for sentiment prediction. Our evaluations demonstrate that both CH-SIMS v2.0 and AV-MC framework enable further research for discovering emotion-bearing acoustic and visual cues and pave the path to interpretable end-to- end HCI applications for real-world scenarios.

However, previous works mainly use traditional machine learning methods to analyze wrist pulse signal. Because wrist pulse signal is high-dimensional and complex, it is difficult for traditional machine learning methods to learn effective information from them. This study aims to explore the utilizing of deep learning methods on wrist pulse signal analysis. We propose a novel multi-kernel Convolutional Neural Network for wrist pulse signal classification. Our model can handle multiple kinds of input features and each of them will pass through a convolutional neural network that has three different sizes of convolution kernel to capture multi-scale information in different time steps. We compare our method with traditional machine learning methods on two tasks: Coronary Atherosclerotic Heart Disease Classification and Traditional Chinese Medicine Constitution yin deficiency and yang deficiency Classification. Besides, we also research the influence of different input features and different channels on wrist pulse signal analysis. The results show that our model significantly improves the performance on the two tasks, which proves the deep learning method is more suitable to deal with complex wrist pulse data.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-kernel Convolutional Neural Network for Wrist Pulse Signal Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhijing Wu","Jingliang Fang","Hua Xu","Kai Gao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1665991444,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665991444,"objectID":"8f098ab084f29b346f2b3e5c00882cda","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/publication/an-in-depth-interactive-and-visualized-platform-for-evaluating-and-analyzing-mrc-models/","publishdate":"2022-10-17T15:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/an-in-depth-interactive-and-visualized-platform-for-evaluating-and-analyzing-mrc-models/","section":"publication","summary":"Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) has made leaps and bounds when focusing on answering questions.

Most existing intent recognition methods have limitations in leveraging the multimodal information due to the restrictions of the benchmark datasets with only text information. This paper introduces a novel dataset for multimodal intent recognition (MIntRec) to address this issue. It formulates coarse-grained and fine-grained intent taxonomies based on the data collected from the TV series Superstore. The dataset consists of 2,224 high-quality samples with text, video, and audio modalities and has multimodal annotations among twenty intent categories. Furthermore, we provide annotated bounding boxes of speakers in each video segment and achieve an automatic process for speaker annotation. MIntRec is helpful for researchers to mine relationships between different modalities to enhance the capability of intent recognition. We extract features from each modality and model cross-modal interactions by adapting three powerful multimodal fusion methods to build baselines. Extensive experiments show that employing the non-verbal modalities achieves substantial improvements compared with the text-only modality, demonstrating the effectiveness of using multimodal information for intent recognition. The gap between the best-performing methods and humans indicates the challenge and importance of this task for the community.

However, it is crucial to estimate the predictive uncertainty in real-world applications to measure how likely the prediction is wrong. Hence it is possible to abstain from the uncertain prediction with low confidence and build a trustworthy system. Prior studies use post-processing ways to measure the predictive uncertainty, such as employing heuristic softmax probability or training a calibrator on top of a trained MRC model. However, they only calibrate the confidence without considering the domain adaptation relationship. To handle the limitations, this paper presents TrustMRC, a non-postprocessing trustworthy MRC system that leverages (1) conditional calibration strategy to get reliable uncertainty, and (2) conditional adversarial learning strategy to learn transfer representations under domain shift setting. On the one hand, to estimate the predictive uncertainty, a conditional calibration module is proposed to predict whether the output of the answer prediction module is correct, and it is combined with an additional ECE constraint to restrict the confidence more reliable. On the other hand, for domain shift, TrustMRC designs a conditional adversarial learning strategy to learn transfer representations through a domain discriminator with uncertainty constraints, which takes both input and uncertainty alignment into account. Besides, TrustMRC is a non-postprocessing model that completes the answer prediction and uncertainty prediction in an end-to-end framework, so that these two sub-tasks can benefit from each other via multi-task learning. Instead of traditional EM and F1 metrics, EM-coverage and F1-coverage curves are used, for the trustworthiness-aware MRC evaluation. The experimental results on SQuAD 1.1, Natural Questions, and NewsQA datasets indicate that TrustMRC can make reliable predictions under domain shift settings.","tags":[],"title":"Trustworthy Machine Reading Comprehension with Conditional Adversarial Calibration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Wang","Hua Xu","Weiwei Yang","Xiaoqiu Huang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1658219044,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658219044,"objectID":"82c559431cef96c2008a5dfa587e6094","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/publication/constrained-hlda-for-topic-discovery-in-chinese-microblogs/","publishdate":"2022-07-19T16:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/constrained-hlda-for-topic-discovery-in-chinese-microblogs/","section":"publication","summary":"Since microblog service became information provider on web scale, research on microblog has begun to focus more on its content mining.

On one hand, the number of topics is fixed as a priori, but in real world, it is input by the users. On the other hand, it ignores the hierarchical information of topics and cannot grow structurally as more data are observed. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised hierarchical topic model, which aims to explore more reasonable topics in the data space by incorporating some constraints into the modeling process that are extracted automatically. The new method is denoted as constrained hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (constrained-hLDA). We conduct experiments on Sina microblog, and evaluate the performance in terms of clustering and empirical likelihood.

However, most of the current EGO-based algorithms for expensive MOPs are limited to low decision dimensions because of the exponential difficulty in high dimensional circumstances. This paper presents High-Dimensional Expensive Multi-objective Optimization with Additive structure (ADD-HDEMO) to solve high-dimensional expensive MOPs via additive structural kernel and identifies two key challenges in this endeavor. First, we integrate multiple sub-objectives in high-dimensional expensive MOPs into a single objective with the decision space unchanged. Then, we infer the dependence correlation between the decision and objective space of the augmented EMOP via an additive GP kernel structure where Gibbs sampling is used to learn the latent additive structure. Furthermore, we parallel the proposed algorithm by introducing a multi-point sampling mechanism when recommending infill points. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on ZDT and DTLZ benchmarks compared with three other EGO-based multi-objective optimization approaches, ParEGO, SMS-EGO and MOEA/D-EGO. Our analyses demonstrate that ADD-HDEMO is effective in solving high-dimensional expensive MOPs.","tags":[],"title":"High-dimensional expensive multi-objective optimization via additive structure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huisheng Mao","Ziqi Yuan","Hua Xu","Wenmeng Yu","Yihe Liu","Kai Gao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1647415444,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647415444,"objectID":"71f77290e373f601482fc2c9952ad45c","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/publication/m-sena/","publishdate":"2022-03-16T15:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/m-sena/","section":"publication","summary":"M-SENA is an open-sourced platform for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis.

Some previous work has proved that storing a few typical samples of old relations and replaying them when learning new relations can effectively avoid forgetting. However, these memory-based methods tend to overfit the memory samples and perform poorly on imbalanced datasets. To solve these challenges, a consistent representation learning method is proposed, which maintains the stability of the relation embedding by adopting contrastive learning and knowledge distillation when replaying memory. Specifically, supervised contrastive learning based on a memory bank is first used to train each new task so that the model can effectively learn the relation representation. Then, contrastive replay is conducted of the samples in memory and makes the model retain the knowledge of historical relations through memory knowledge distillation to prevent the catastrophic forgetting of the old task. The proposed method can better learn consistent representations to alleviate forgetting effectively.

To be specific, a word-level encoder with a novel convolution gate is first built to filter out irrelevant contextual information. Based on the representation extracted by word-level encoder, a graph reasoning network is designed to utilize the context among utterance-level, where the entire conversation is treated as a fully connected graph, utterances as nodes, and attention scores between utterances as edges. The proposed model is a general framework for conversation understanding tasks, which can be flexibly applied on most conversation datasets without changing the network architecture. Furthermore, we revise the tensor fusion network by adding a residual connection to explore cross-modal conversation understanding. For uni-modal scene (text modality), experiments show that the proposed method surpasses current state-of-the-art methods on emotion recognition, intent classification, and dialogue act identification tasks.

However, the results still fail to meet the quality requirements of the emotion classifiers in FER. To address the above issues, this paper proposed a novel framework based on reinforcement learning for pre-selecting useful images(RLPS) for emotion classification in FER, which is made up of two modules: image selector and rough emotion classifier. Image selector is used to select useful images for emotion classification through reinforcement strategy and rough emotion classifier acts as a teacher to train image selector. Our framework improves classification performance by improving the quality of the dataset and can be applied to any classifier.

Much recent research in short text becomes increasingly significant, such as topic inference for short text. Biterm topic model (BTM) benefits from the word co-occurrence patterns of the corpus, which makes it perform better than conventional topic models in uncovering latent semantic relevance for short text. However, BTM resorts to Gibbs sampling to infer topics, which is very time consuming, especially for large-scale datasets or when the number of topics is extremely large. It requires O(K) operations per sample for K topics, where K denotes the number of topics in the corpus. In this paper, we propose an acceleration algorithm of BTM, FastBTM, using an efficient sampling method for BTM, which converges much faster than BTM without degrading topic quality. FastBTM is based on Metropolis-Hastings and alias method, both of which have been widely adopted in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and achieved outstanding speedup. Our FastBTM can effectively reduce the sampling complexity of biterm topic model from O(K) to O(1) amortized time. We carry out a number of experiments on three datasets including two short text datasets, Tweets2011 Collection dataset and Yahoo! Answers dataset, and one long document dataset, Enron dataset. Our experimental results show that when the number of topics K increases, the gap in running time speed between FastBTM and BTM gets especially larger. In addition, our FastBTM is effective for both short text datasets and long document datasets.","tags":[],"title":"FastBTM: Reducing the Sampling Time for Biterm Topic Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hua Xu","Jiyun Zou"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1598858644,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598858644,"objectID":"88c292635c82e75a0782bf542017692d","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/publication/hgfm/","publishdate":"2019-08-31T15:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/hgfm/","section":"publication","summary":"To solve the problem of poor classification performance of multiple complex emotions in acoustic modalities, we propose a hierarchical grained and feature model (HGFM).

In this paper, we suggest to view objective reduction as a multiobjective search problem and introduce three multiobjective formulations of the problem, where the first two formulations are both based on preservation of the dominance structure and the third one utilizes the correlation between objectives. For each multiobjective formulation, a multiobjective objective reduction algorithm is proposed by employing the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II to generate a Pareto front of nondominated objective subsets that can offer decision support to the user. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of two major categories of objective reduction approaches based on several theorems, with the aim of revealing their strengths and limitations. Lastly, the performance of the proposed multiobjective algorithms is studied extensively on various benchmark problems and two real-world problems.

However, BERT fine-tuning may be unstable on a small-scale dataset. Besides, in our experiments, directly fine-tuning BERT on extending sophisticated task-specific layers did not take advantage of the features of task-specific layers and even restrict the performance of BERT module.

We propose two simple models to fully learn the emotional features of the POS of words. Every model consists of the long short-term memory (LSTM) network as input encoders and the component of attention mechanism. One model is to concatenate the POS tags of vectors into the hidden states of representations generated by LSTM as raw feature representations and put them into the component of attention mechanism to generate the text representation toward a special emotion. The other is to use both LSTM and attention mechanism to model the context representation of words and those of POS tags respectively and concatenate these context representations as the text representation toward a special emotion. We conduct some experiments on datasets for evaluation and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, where the datasets consist of the open-source dataset from NLPCC\u0026 2014 and the dataset of manual annotation.

However, how to discover the topics of streaming short texts has become an important task for many content analysis applications. Conventional topic models such as Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) will suffer from sparsity problem when we infer the latent topics from short texts with them. The reason is that they derive topics from document-level word co-occurrence by modeling each document as a mixture of topics. Different from the above idea, Biterm Topic Model (BTM) discovers topics in short texts by directly modeling the generation of word co-occurrence patterns in the whole corpus. But semantic information is lacking for short texts. In this paper, in order to alleviate the sparsity problem, keep the semantic information of documents and get the latent topic information of streaming short texts immediately, we propose a joint topic model for Chinese streaming short texts (CTM) based on the online algorithms of LDA and BTM. Experiments on short texts from Sina Weibo show that our joint topic model can discover more precise topics and carry out more applications.

Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of two major categories of objective reduction approaches based on several theorems, with the aim of revealing their strengths and limitations.

The service has gained worldwide popularity since it was created in March 2006, with more than 316 million monthly active users in June 2015 who posted 500 million tweets per day. As the number of available tweets grows, the problem of managing tweets becomes extremely difficult, which could lead to information overload. To avoid this problem, people use the hashtag symbol # before a relevant keyword or phrase in their tweets to categorize those tweets and help them show more easily in each Twitter search. Furthermore, hashtags can be used to collect public opinions on events and their ideas at the individual, community or even the world level. Incorporating hashtags to obtain better performance such as sentiment classification and breaking events detection also has attracted considerable research attention in recent years. However, there are very few tweets containing hashtags, which impedes the quality of search results and their further usage in various applications. Therefore, hashtag recommendation has become a particularly important research problem. In this paper, we first propose a novel model, namely online Twitter-User LDA to learn Twitter users’ dynamic interests. Then considering the shortness, sparsity, and high volume of tweets, we introduce an effective method to discover the latent topics of streaming tweet content, which uses recently proposed incremental biterm topic model (IBTM). We finally design an automatic hashtag recommendation method called User-IBTM by combining the online Twitter-User LDA and IBTM.

Traditionally, EC focuses on solving a single optimization task at a time.

Very recently, a new paradigm in EC, namely, multifactorial optimization (MFO) has been introduced to explore the potential of evolutionary multitasking, which can serve the purpose of simultaneously optimizing multiple PCOPs in SCNs. In this paper, the evolutionary multitasking of PCOPs is studied. In particular, based on a recently proposed multitasking engine known as the multifactorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA), two novel mechanisms, namely, a new unified representation and a new survivor selection procedure, are introduced to better adapt to PCOPs. Experimental results obtained on well-known benchmark problems not only show the benefits of the two new mechanisms but also verify the promise of evolutionary multitasking for PCOPs. In addition, the results on a test case involving four optimization tasks demonstrate the potential scalability of evolutionary multitasking to many-task environments.","tags":[],"title":"Evolutionary multitasking in permutation-based combinatorial optimization problems: Realization with TSP, QAP, LOP, and JSP","type":"publication"},{"authors":["WenhaoZhang","JianqiuJi","JunZhu","JianminLi","Hua Xu","BoZhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600522718,"objectID":"ca2321ef330a70a051b1971c748ae7ae","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/publication/bithash/","publishdate":"2020-09-19T13:38:37.383344Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bithash/","section":"publication","summary":"Locality Sensitive Hashing has been applied to detecting near-duplicate images, videos and web documents.

BitHash may provide accurate estimation, and as the pairwise Jaccard similarity increases, the variance ratio of BitHash over the original min-hash decreases. Furthermore, BitHash compresses each data sample into a compact binary hash code while preserving the pairwise similarity of the original data. The binary code can be used as a compressed and informative representation in replacement of the original data for subsequent processing. For example, it can be naturally integrated with a classifier like SVM. We apply BitHash to two typical applications, near-duplicate image detection and sentiment analysis. Experiments on real user’s photo collection and a popular sentiment analysis data set show that, the classification accuracy of our proposed method for two applications could approach the state-of-the-art method, while BitHash only requires a significantly smaller storage space.","tags":["\"Locality Sensitive Hashing\"","\"BitHash\"","\"Near-duplicate detection\"","\"Machine learning\"","\"Sentiment analysis\"","\"Storage efficiency\""],"title":"BitHash: An efficient bitwise Locality Sensitive Hashing method with applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["YunfengXu","Hua Xu","DongwenZhang","YanZhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600522717,"objectID":"495d62bb5e5488950d5cefcd567c9840","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/publication/finding-overlapping-community-from-social-networks-based-on-community-forest-model/","publishdate":"2020-09-19T13:38:36.677344Z","relpermalink":"/publication/finding-overlapping-community-from-social-networks-based-on-community-forest-model/","section":"publication","summary":"Overlapping community detection is the key research work to discover and explore the social networks.

However, NSGA-III still relies on Pareto-dominance to push the population towards Pareto front (PF), leaving room for the improvement of its convergence ability. In this paper, an improved NSGA-III procedure, called 牟-NSGA-III, is proposed, aiming to better tradeoff the convergence and diversity in many-objective optimization. In 牟-NSGA-III, the non-dominated sorting scheme based on the proposed 牟-dominance is employed to rank solutions in the environmental selection phase, which ensures both convergence and diversity.

As to the form of EFR, it can be regarded as an extension of average and maximum ranking methods which have been shown promising for many-objective problems. The significant change is that EFR adopts more general fitness functions instead of objective functions, which would make it easier for EFR to balance the convergence and diversity in many-objective optimization. In the experimental studies, the influence of several fitness functions and ensemble ranking schemes on the performance of EFR is fist investigated. Afterwards, EFR is compared with two state-of-the-art methods (MOEA/D and NSGA-III) on well-known test problems. The computational results show that EFR significantly outperforms MOEA/D and NSGA-III on most instances, especially for those having a high number of objectives.","tags":["\"average ranking\"","\"MOEA/D\"","\"maximum ranking\"","\"ensemble fitness ranking\"","\"fitness function\"","\"NSGA-III\"","\"many-objective optimization\""],"title":"Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization Using Ensemble Fitness Ranking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["WeiyuanLi","Hua Xu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600522722,"objectID":"eb4f236771b0188dbca7d3092873ab5e","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/publication/text-based-emotion-classification-using-emotion-cause-extraction/","publishdate":"2020-09-19T13:38:41.466347Z","relpermalink":"/publication/text-based-emotion-classification-using-emotion-cause-extraction/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, increasing impact of social networks on people’s opinions and decision making has attracted lots of attention. Microblogging, one of the most popular social network applications that allows people to share ideas and discuss over various topics, is taken as a rich resource of opinion and emotion data. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel method for identifying emotions in microblog posts. Unlike traditional approaches which are mostly based on statistical methods, we try to infer and extract the reasons of emotions by importing knowledge and theories from other fields such as Sociology. Based on the theory that a triggering cause event is an integral part of emotion, the technique of emotion cause extraction is used as a crucial step to improve the quality of selected features. First, after thorough analysis on sample data we constructed an automatic rule-based system to detect and extract the cause event of each emotional post. We build an emotion corpus with Chinese microblog posts labeled by human annotators. Then a classifier is trained to classify emotions in microblog posts based on extracted cause events. The overall performance of our system is very promising. The experiment results show that our approach is effective in selecting informative features. Our system outperformed the baseline noticeably in most cases, suggesting its great potential. This exploration should provide a new way to look at the emotion classification task and lay the ground for future research on textual emotion processing.","tags":["\"Emotion classification\"","\"Emotion cause extraction\"","\"Microblogging\"","\"Weibo\""],"title":"Text-based emotion classification using emotion cause extraction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["WeiWang","Hua Xu","Xiaoqiu Huang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1380585600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600523746,"objectID":"19ba18be40238c84b2af736b7ef526bc","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/publication/implicit-feature-detection-via-a-constrained-topic-model-and-svm/","publishdate":"2020-09-19T13:55:45.407589Z","relpermalink":"/publication/implicit-feature-detection-via-a-constrained-topic-model-and-svm/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Implicit Feature Detection via a Constrained Topic Model and SVM","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuan Yuan","Hua Xu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1376900644,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1376900644,"objectID":"8159000fc76211255dda4e709f1e5185","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/publication/multiobjective-flexible-job-shop-scheduling-using-memetic-algorithms/","publishdate":"2013-08-19T16:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/multiobjective-flexible-job-shop-scheduling-using-memetic-algorithms/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we propose new memetic algorithms (MAs) for the multiobjective flexible job shop scheduling problem (MO-FJSP) with the objectives to minimize the makespan, total workload, and critical workload.

In L1BOA, Bayesian networks as probabilistic models are learned in two steps. First, candidate parents of each variable in Bayesian networks are detected by means of L1-regularized logistic regression, with the aim of leading a sparse but nearly optimized network structure. Second, the greedy search, which is restricted to the candidate parent-child pairs, is deployed to identify the final structure. Compared with the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), L1BOA improves the efficiency of structure learning due to the reduction and automated control of network complexity introduced with L1-regularized learning. Experimental studies on different types of benchmark problems show that L1BOA not only outperforms BOA when no prior knowledge about problem structure is available, but also achieves and even exceeds the best performance of BOA that applies explicit controls on network complexity. Furthermore, Bayesian networks built by L1BOA and BOA during evolution are analysed and compared, which demonstrates that L1BOA is able to build simpler, yet more accurate probabilistic models.","tags":[],"title":"Effective Structure Learning for Estimation of Distribution Algorithms via L1-Regularized Bayesian Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuan Yuan","Hua Xu","Jiadong Yang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600522723,"objectID":"46c5262473bbe0d43c6d815a83c10361","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/publication/a-hybrid-harmony-search-algorithm-for-the-flexible-job-shop-scheduling-problem/","publishdate":"2020-09-19T13:38:42.870343Z","relpermalink":"/publication/a-hybrid-harmony-search-algorithm-for-the-flexible-job-shop-scheduling-problem/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, a novel hybrid harmony search (HHS) algorithm based on the integrated approach, is proposed for solving the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) with the criterion to minimize makespan.

It has been shown that standard recombination operators in EAs do not assure an effective evolutionary search to solve sophisticated problems that contain strong interactions between features. On the other hand, when dealing with real-world classification tasks, irrelevant features not only complicate the problem but also incur unnecessary matchings in GBML systems, which increase the computational cost a lot. To handle the two problems mentioned above in an integrated manner, a new Pittsburgh-style GBML system is proposed. In the proposed method, classifiers are generated and recombined at two levels. At the high level, classifiers are recombined by rule-wise uniform crossover operators since each classifier consists of a variable-size rule set. At the low level, single rules contained in classifiers are reproduced via sampling Bayesian networks that characterize the global statistical information extracted from promising rules found so far. Furthermore, according to the statistical information in the rule population, an embedded approach is presented to detect and remove redundant features incrementally following the evolution of rule population. Results of empirical evaluation show that the proposed method outperforms the original Pittsburgh-style GBML system in terms of classification accuracy while reducing the computational cost. Furthermore, the proposed method is also competitive to other non-evolutionary, highly used machine learning methods.

Previous related research mainly relied on explicit features but ignored implicit features. However, the implicit features, which are implied by some words or phrases, are so significant that they can express the users’ opinion and help us to better understand the users’ comments. It is a big challenge to detect these implicit features in Chinese product reviews, due to the complexity of Chinese. This paper is mainly centered on implicit features identification in Chinese product reviews. A novel hybrid association rule mining method is proposed for this task. The core idea of this approach is mining as many association rules as possible via several complementary algorithms. Firstly, we extract candidate feature indicators based word segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging and feature clustering, then compute the co-occurrence degree between the candidate feature indicators and the feature words using five collocation extraction algorithms. Each indicator and the corresponding feature word constitute a rule (feature indicator → feature word). The best rules in five different rule sets are chosen as the basic rules. Next, three methods are proposed to mine some possible reasonable rules from the lower co-occurrence feature indicators and non indicator words. Finally, the latest rules are used to identify implicit features and the results are compared with the previous. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed approach is competent at the task, especially via using several expanding methods. The recall is effectively improved, suggesting that the shortcomings of the basic rules have been overcome to certain extent. Besides those high co-occurrence degree indicators, the final rules also contain uncommon rules.","tags":["\"Opinion mining\"","\"Implicit features\"","\"Hybrid association rule mining\"","\"Collocation extraction\""],"title":"Implicit feature identification via hybrid association rule mining","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hua Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"Course Classification: Public Elective Courses of Tsinghua University\nLecturer: Hua Xu\nTarget Audience: All Graduate and Undergraduate Students\nTeaching Time：2013 - Today\n","date":1356969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356969600,"objectID":"e7d4ecfaf4b1f29cd65dd9ec01f1f6ad","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/talk/industrial-data-mining/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/industrial-data-mining/","section":"talk","summary":"Public Elective Courses of Tsinghua University","tags":[],"title":"Industrial Data Mining","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Yuan Wang","Hua Xu","Peifa Jia"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1350894244,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1350894244,"objectID":"154f7ec83ba61ae026343d969f5abdfa","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/publication/a-hop-by-hop-network-coding-algorithm-for-aviation-communications-networks/","publishdate":"2012-10-22T16:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/a-hop-by-hop-network-coding-algorithm-for-aviation-communications-networks/","section":"publication","summary":"Considering the feature of intensive node mobility in aviation communication networks, a hop-by-hop network coding algorithm based on Ad Hoc networks is proposed in this paper.

In recent years, more and more people express their opinions about products online, and both the feedback of manufacturers’ products or their competitors’ products could be easily collected. However, it’s impossible for manufacturers to read every review to analyze the weakness of their products. Therefore, finding product weakness from online reviews becomes a meaningful work. In this paper, we introduce such an expert system, Weakness Finder, which can help manufacturers find their product weakness from Chinese reviews by using aspects based sentiment analysis. An aspect is an attribute or component of a product, such as price, degerm, moisturizing are the aspects of the body wash products. Weakness Finder extracts the features and groups explicit features by using morpheme based method and Hownet based similarity measure, and identify and group the implicit features with collocation selection method for each aspect. Then utilize sentence based sentiment analysis method to determine the polarity of each aspect in sentences. The weakness of product could be found because the weakness is probably the most unsatisfied aspect in customers’ reviews, or the aspect which is more unsatisfied when compared with their competitor’s product reviews.

The proposed approach utilizes the divide- and-conquer strategy to manage two populations in parallel, corresponding to the selected feature subsets and the rule sets of classifier respectively, in which a memetic feature selection algorithm is adopted to evolve the feature subset population while a Pittsburgh-style learning classifier system is used to carry out the classifier evolution.

Third, the proposed algorithm restricts the use of GA to evolve the task-processor mapping solutions, while taking advantage of an upward-ranking heuristic mostly used by traditional list scheduling approaches to determine the task sequence assignment in each processor. Empirical results on benchmark task graphs of several well-known parallel applications, which have been validated by the use of non-parametric statistical tests, show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms several related algorithms in terms of the schedule quality.

Most of the existing methods for sentiment classification ignore word sequence and unlabeled test documents' structural information. This paper proposes a transductive learning based algorithm considering both of these two types of information. The proposed algorithm is implemented by firstly selecting key substrings in the suffix tree constructed from the strings in training and unlabeled test documents and then converting each original text document to a bag of numbers of the key substrings. Finally, SVM is employed to classify the converted documents. Experiments on the open dataset (16,000 Chinese reviews) demonstrate promising performance of the proposed algorithm, the accuracy being over 93.15%, which is much better than the performance of the existing sentiment classification methods, such as n-gram features based classification algorithms.

However, due to the nature of contour lines for the adopted aggregation functions, they usually fail to preserve the diversity in high-dimensional objective space even by using diverse weight vectors. To address this problem, we propose to maintain the desired diversity of solutions in their evolutionary process explicitly by exploiting the perpendicular distance from the solution to the weight vector in the objective space, which achieves better balance between convergence and diversity in many-objective optimization. The idea is implemented to enhance two well-performing decomposition-based algorithms, i.e., MOEA, based on decomposition and ensemble fitness ranking. The two enhanced algorithms are compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms and a series of comparative experiments are conducted on a number of test problems from two well-known test suites.

This kind of interface component can support not only a communicating function but also a reliability function (information feedback function).","tags":[],"title":"A Generic Conceptual Model of Interface Components in Open Robot Controller","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hua Xu","Peifa Jia","Yannan Zhao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1004343844,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1004343844,"objectID":"7a5aa812ea3d7b8c60e8ca08d4915716","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/publication/conceiving-analyzing-modeling-verifying-and-developing-the-clews-of-modeling-open-software-architectures-of-robot-controllers/","publishdate":"2001-10-29T16:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/conceiving-analyzing-modeling-verifying-and-developing-the-clews-of-modeling-open-software-architectures-of-robot-controllers/","section":"publication","summary":"Openness is one of the features of modem robot controllers.

In this paper, an evolutionary algorithm based on a new dominance relation is proposed for many-objective optimization. The proposed evolutionary algorithm aims to enhance the convergence of the recently suggested nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III by exploiting the fitness evaluation scheme in the MOEA based on decomposition, but still inherit the strength of the former in diversity maintenance. In the proposed algorithm, the nondominated sorting scheme based on the introduced new dominance relation is employed to rank solutions in the environmental selection phase, ensuring both convergence and diversity. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a number of well-known benchmark problems having 3-15 objectives and compared against eight state-of-the-art algorithms. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can work well on almost all the test functions considered in this paper, and it is compared favorably with the other many-objective optimizers. Additionally, a parametric study is provided to investigate the influence of a key parameter in the proposed algorithm.","tags":[],"title":"A New Dominance Relation Based Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization","type":"publication"}]
