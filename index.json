robots can interact naturally with the work environment, humans, and other robots, adapt to complex dynamic environments autonomously, and work collaboratively. [Keen and considerate] natural interaction is one of the hot research issues of inclusive service robots. At present, there is an urgent need for robots and humans to have the ability to understand the intention of interactive dialogue. This book is based on the field of human-computer understanding based on deep learning methods. Starting from the knowledge of human-computer dialogue intentions, it systematically introduces intention recognition, unknown intention detection, and new intention discovery in human-computer dialogue.

Machine Reading Comprehension aims to incrementally learn from a continuous data stream across time without access the previous seen data, which is crucial for the development of real-world MRC systems. However, it is a great challenge to learn a new domain incrementally without catastrophically forgetting previous knowledge. In this paper, MA-MRC, a continual MRC model with uncertainty-aware fixed Memory and Adversarial domain adaptation, is proposed. In MA-MRC, a fixed size memory stores a small number of samples in previous domain data along with an uncertainty-aware updating strategy when new domain data arrives. For incremental learning, MA-MRC not only keeps a stable understanding by learning both memory and new domain data, but also makes full use of the domain adaptation relationship between them by adversarial learning strategy. The experimental results show that MA-MRC is superior to strong baselines and has a substantial incremental learning ability without catastrophically forgetting under two different continual MRC settings.","tags":[],"title":"Continual Machine Reading Comprehension via Uncertainty-aware Fixed Memory and Adversarial Domain Adaptation ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Li Chen","Hua Xu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1658219044,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658219044,"objectID":"e609e769d5d1a86ae3e279650919b148","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/publication/mfenas/","publishdate":"2022-07-19T16:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mfenas/","section":"publication","summary":"Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to automatically find neural network architectures competitive with human-designed ones. Despite the remarkable progress achieved, existing NAS methods still suffer from vast computational resources cost. Inspired by MFEA, we model the NAS task as a two-factorial problem and propose a multifactorial evolutionary neural architecture search (MFENAS) algorithm to solve it. MFENAS divides a population into two subgroups according to factors, and then the factors influence the evolution and knowledge transfer between subgroups. Experimental results of NATS-Bench demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed MFENAS in finding optimal structures under resource constraints compared to other state-of-the-art methods.","tags":[],"title":"MFENAS: Multifactorial Evolution for Neural Architecture Search","type":"publication"},{"authors":["WangHongyan","XuHua","Yuan Yuan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1651393444,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651393444,"objectID":"505d3cfdcb4ae94233ab44aa73a9dfc5","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/publication/high-dimensional-expensive-multi-objective-optimization-via-additive-structure/","publishdate":"2022-05-01T16:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/high-dimensional-expensive-multi-objective-optimization-via-additive-structure/","section":"publication","summary":"Expensive multi-objective problems (MOPs) are extremely challenging due to the high evaluation cost to find satisfying solutions with adequate precision, especially in high-dimensional cases. However, most of the current EGO-based algorithms for expensive MOPs are limited to low decision dimensions because of the exponential difficulty in high dimensional circumstances. This paper presents High-Dimensional Expensive Multi-objective Optimization with Additive structure (ADD-HDEMO) to solve high-dimensional expensive MOPs via additive structural kernel and identifies two key challenges in this endeavor. First, we integrate multiple sub-objectives in high-dimensional expensive MOPs into a single objective with the decision space unchanged. Then, we infer the dependence correlation between the decision and objective space of the augmented EMOP via an additive GP kernel structure where Gibbs sampling is used to learn the latent additive structure.

Some previous work has proved that storing a few typical samples of old relations and replaying them when learning new relations can effectively avoid forgetting. However, these memory-based methods tend to overfit the memory samples and perform poorly on imbalanced datasets. To solve these challenges, a consistent representation learning method is proposed, which maintains the stability of the relation embedding by adopting contrastive learning and knowledge distillation when replaying memory. Specifically, supervised contrastive learning based on a memory bank is first used to train each new task so that the model can effectively learn the relation representation. Then, contrastive replay is conducted of the samples in memory and makes the model retain the knowledge of historical relations through memory knowledge distillation to prevent the catastrophic forgetting of the old task. The proposed method can better learn consistent representations to alleviate forgetting effectively.

To be specific, a word-level encoder with a novel convolution gate is first built to filter out irrelevant contextual information. Based on the representation extracted by word-level encoder, a graph reasoning network is designed to utilize the context among utterance-level, where the entire conversation is treated as a fully connected graph, utterances as nodes, and attention scores between utterances as edges. The proposed model is a general framework for conversation understanding tasks, which can be flexibly applied on most conversation datasets without changing the network architecture. Furthermore, we revise the tensor fusion network by adding a residual connection to explore cross-modal conversation understanding. For uni-modal scene (text modality), experiments show that the proposed method surpasses current state-of-the-art methods on emotion recognition, intent classification, and dialogue act identification tasks.

However, BTM resorts to Gibbs sampling to infer topics, which is very time consuming, especially for large-scale datasets or when the number of topics is extremely large. It requires O(K) operations per sample for K topics, where K denotes the number of topics in the corpus. In this paper, we propose an acceleration algorithm of BTM, FastBTM, using an efficient sampling method for BTM, which converges much faster than BTM without degrading topic quality. FastBTM is based on Metropolis-Hastings and alias method, both of which have been widely adopted in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and achieved outstanding speedup. Our FastBTM can effectively reduce the sampling complexity of biterm topic model from O(K) to O(1) amortized time.

Objective reduction can alleviate such difficulties by removing the redundant objectives in the original objective set, which has become one of the most important techniques in many-objective optimization. In this paper, we suggest to view objective reduction as a multiobjective search problem and introduce three multiobjective formulations of the problem, where the first two formulations are both based on preservation of the dominance structure and the third one utilizes the correlation between objectives. For each multiobjective formulation, a multiobjective objective reduction algorithm is proposed by employing the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II to generate a Pareto front of nondominated objective subsets that can offer decision support to the user. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of two major categories of objective reduction approaches based on several theorems, with the aim of revealing their strengths and limitations. Lastly, the performance of the proposed multiobjective algorithms is studied extensively on various benchmark problems and two real-world problems. Numerical results and comparisons are then shown to highlight the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed multiobjective algorithms over existing state-of-the-art approaches in the related field.","tags":[],"title":"Objective Reduction in Many-Objective Optimization: Evolutionary Multiobjective Approaches and Comprehensive Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenmeng Yu","Hua Xu","FanyangMeng"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1594538644,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594538644,"objectID":"c8c941131fbf6a3d92f09b21b261513a","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/publication/chsims/","publishdate":"2020-08-31T15:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chsims/","section":"publication","summary":"Previous studies in multimodal sentiment analysis have used limited datasets, which only contain unified multimodal annotations.

We calibrate the confidence of the softmax outputs to compute the calibrated confidence score (i.e., SofterMax) and use it to calculate the decision boundary for unknown intent detection. Furthermore, we feed the feature representations learned by the deep neural networks into traditional novelty detection algorithm to detect unknown intents from different perspectives.

The service has gained worldwide popularity since it was created in March 2006, with more than 316 million monthly active users in June 2015 who posted 500 million tweets per day. As the number of available tweets grows, the problem of managing tweets becomes extremely difficult, which could lead to information overload. To avoid this problem, people use the hashtag symbol # before a relevant keyword or phrase in their tweets to categorize those tweets and help them show more easily in each Twitter search. Furthermore, hashtags can be used to collect public opinions on events and their ideas at the individual, community or even the world level. Incorporating hashtags to obtain better performance such as sentiment classification and breaking events detection also has attracted considerable research attention in recent years. However, there are very few tweets containing hashtags, which impedes the quality of search results and their further usage in various applications. Therefore, hashtag recommendation has become a particularly important research problem. In this paper, we first propose a novel model, namely online Twitter-User LDA to learn Twitter users’ dynamic interests. Then considering the shortness, sparsity, and high volume of tweets, we introduce an effective method to discover the latent topics of streaming tweet content, which uses recently proposed incremental biterm topic model (IBTM). We finally design an automatic hashtag recommendation method called User-IBTM by combining the online Twitter-User LDA and IBTM.

However, most of existing research within this area focused on improving the environmental selection procedure, and little work has been done on the effect of variation operators. In this paper, we conduct an experimental investigation of variation operators in a typical reference-point based MOEA, i.e., NSGA-III. First, we provide a new NSGA-III variant, i.e., NSGA-III-DE, which introduces differential evolution (DE) operator into NSGA-III, and we further examine the effect of two main control parameters in NSGA-III-DE. Second, we have an experimental analysis of the search behavior of NSGA-III-DE and NSGA-III. We observe that NSGA-III-DE is generally better at exploration whereas NSGA-III normally has advantages in exploitation.

Most of the existing researches are centered on the extraction of lexical features and syntactic features, while the semantic relationships between words are ignored. In this paper, in order to get the semantic features, we propose a method for sentiment classification based on word2vec and SVMperf. Our research consists of two parts of work. First of all, we use word2vec to cluster the similar features for purpose of showing the capability of word2vec to capture the semantic features in selected domain and Chinese language. And then, we train and classify the comment texts using word2vec again and SVMperf. In the process, the lexicon-based and part-of-speech-based feature selection methods are respectively adopted to generate the training file. We conduct the experiments on the data set of Chinese comments on clothing products.

However, NSGA-III still relies on Pareto-dominance to push the population towards Pareto front (PF), leaving room for the improvement of its convergence ability. In this paper, an improved NSGA-III procedure, called 牟-NSGA-III, is proposed, aiming to better tradeoff the convergence and diversity in many-objective optimization. In 牟-NSGA-III, the non-dominated sorting scheme based on the proposed 牟-dominance is employed to rank solutions in the environmental selection phase, which ensures both convergence and diversity.

In this paper, we propose and implement a novel method for identifying emotions in microblog posts. Unlike traditional approaches which are mostly based on statistical methods, we try to infer and extract the reasons of emotions by importing knowledge and theories from other fields such as Sociology. Based on the theory that a triggering cause event is an integral part of emotion, the technique of emotion cause extraction is used as a crucial step to improve the quality of selected features. First, after thorough analysis on sample data we constructed an automatic rule-based system to detect and extract the cause event of each emotional post. We build an emotion corpus with Chinese microblog posts labeled by human annotators. Then a classifier is trained to classify emotions in microblog posts based on extracted cause events. The overall performance of our system is very promising. The experiment results show that our approach is effective in selecting informative features. Our system outperformed the baseline noticeably in most cases, suggesting its great potential.

To handle the two problems mentioned above in an integrated manner, a new Pittsburgh-style GBML system is proposed. In the proposed method, classifiers are generated and recombined at two levels. At the high level, classifiers are recombined by rule-wise uniform crossover operators since each classifier consists of a variable-size rule set. At the low level, single rules contained in classifiers are reproduced via sampling Bayesian networks that characterize the global statistical information extracted from promising rules found so far. Furthermore, according to the statistical information in the rule population, an embedded approach is presented to detect and remove redundant features incrementally following the evolution of rule population. Results of empirical evaluation show that the proposed method outperforms the original Pittsburgh-style GBML system in terms of classification accuracy while reducing the computational cost.

Previous related research mainly relied on explicit features but ignored implicit features. However, the implicit features, which are implied by some words or phrases, are so significant that they can express the users’ opinion and help us to better understand the users’ comments. It is a big challenge to detect these implicit features in Chinese product reviews, due to the complexity of Chinese. This paper is mainly centered on implicit features identification in Chinese product reviews. A novel hybrid association rule mining method is proposed for this task. The core idea of this approach is mining as many association rules as possible via several complementary algorithms. Firstly, we extract candidate feature indicators based word segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging and feature clustering, then compute the co-occurrence degree between the candidate feature indicators and the feature words using five collocation extraction algorithms. Each indicator and the corresponding feature word constitute a rule (feature indicator → feature word). The best rules in five different rule sets are chosen as the basic rules. Next, three methods are proposed to mine some possible reasonable rules from the lower co-occurrence feature indicators and non indicator words. Finally, the latest rules are used to identify implicit features and the results are compared with the previous.

In this paper, we propose a Pittsburgh-style learning classifier system based on the Bayesian optimization algorithm with the aim of improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the rule structure exploration. In the proposed method, classifiers are generated and recombined at two levels. At the lower level, single rules contained in classifiers are produced by sampling Bayesian networks which characterize the global statistical information extracted from the current promising rules in the search space. At the higher level, classifiers are recombined by rule-wise uniform crossover operators to keep the semantics of rules in each classifier. Experimental studies on both artificial and real world binary classification problems show that the proposed method converges faster while achieving solutions with the same or even higher accuracy compared with the original Pittsburgh-style LCSs.","tags":["\"Learning classifier system\"","\"Genetics-based machine learning\"","\"Estimation of distribution algorithm\"","\"Bayesian optimization algorithm\"","\"Evolutionary computation\""],"title":"Effective search for Pittsburgh learning classifier systems via estimation of distribution algorithms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["WenhaoZhang","Hua Xu","Wei Wan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600522726,"objectID":"3491f2d19347a554bb739ade0035aded","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/publication/weakness-finder/","publishdate":"2020-09-19T13:38:45.661348Z","relpermalink":"/publication/weakness-finder/","section":"publication","summary":"Finding the weakness of the products from the customers’ feedback can help manufacturers improve their product quality and competitive strength. In recent years, more and more people express their opinions about products online, and both the feedback of manufacturers’ products or their competitors’ products could be easily collected. However, it’s impossible for manufacturers to read every review to analyze the weakness of their products. Therefore, finding product weakness from online reviews becomes a meaningful work. In this paper, we introduce such an expert system, Weakness Finder, which can help manufacturers find their product weakness from Chinese reviews by using aspects based sentiment analysis. An aspect is an attribute or component of a product, such as price, degerm, moisturizing are the aspects of the body wash products. Weakness Finder extracts the features and groups explicit features by using morpheme based method and Hownet based similarity measure, and identify and group the implicit features with collocation selection method for each aspect. Then utilize sentence based sentiment analysis method to determine the polarity of each aspect in sentences. The weakness of product could be found because the weakness is probably the most unsatisfied aspect in customers’ reviews, or the aspect which is more unsatisfied when compared with their competitor’s product reviews. Weakness Finder has been used to help a body wash manufacturer find their product weakness, and our experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the Weakness Finder.","tags":["\"Product weakness\"","\"Business intelligence\"","\"Sentiment analysis\"","\"Feature grouping\""],"title":"Weakness Finder: Find product weakness from Chinese reviews by using aspects based sentiment analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yun Wen","Hua Xu","Jiadong Yang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600522729,"objectID":"99cf60281c3f77112b52eefd34837b20","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/publication/a-heuristic-based-hybrid-genetic-variable-neighborhood-search-algorithm-for-task-scheduling-in-heterogeneous-multiprocessor-system/","publishdate":"2020-09-19T13:38:49.188341Z","relpermalink":"/publication/a-heuristic-based-hybrid-genetic-variable-neighborhood-search-algorithm-for-task-scheduling-in-heterogeneous-multiprocessor-system/","section":"publication","summary":"Effective task scheduling, which is essential for achieving high performance in a heterogeneous multiprocessor system, remains a challenging problem despite extensive studies.

To address this problem, we propose to maintain the desired diversity of solutions in their evolutionary process explicitly by exploiting the perpendicular distance from the solution to the weight vector in the objective space, which achieves better balance between convergence and diversity in many-objective optimization. The idea is implemented to enhance two well-performing decomposition-based algorithms, i.e., MOEA, based on decomposition and ensemble fitness ranking. The two enhanced algorithms are compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms and a series of comparative experiments are conducted on a number of test problems from two well-known test suites.

Moreover, the proposed approach features in that each decomposed subspace can be assigned an individual scaling factor, which helps to solve problems with special dimension property.","tags":["\"cross entropy\"","\"adaptive variance scaling\"","\"estimation of distirbution algorithms\"","\"evolutionary computation\""],"title":"Cross Entropy and Adaptive Variance Scaling in Continuous EDA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junhui Deng"],"categories":null,"content":"Course Classification: Tsinghua University Computer Department Undergraduate Professional Basic Course\nLecturer：Junhui Deng\nTarget Audience: Computer Science Undergraduate\nTeaching Time：2001 - 2006\n","date":978278400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":978278400,"objectID":"b7caabb0e4bde45ecc0519114b6a051c","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/talk/data-structure-cs/","publishdate":"2001-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/data-structure-cs/","section":"talk","summary":"Tsinghua University Computer Department Undergraduate Professional Basic Course","tags":[],"title":"Data Strcture","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Junhui Deng"],"categories":null,"content":"Course Classification: Public Elective Courses of Tsinghua University\nLecturer：Junhui Deng\nTarget Audience: All Undergraduate Students\nTeaching Time：2002 - Today\n","date":978278400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":978278400,"objectID":"970c56d891d3e1abdca0aaf1b5140c8d","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/talk/data-structure/","publishdate":"2001-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/data-structure/","section":"talk","summary":"National Excellent Course, Public Elective Course of Tsinghua University","tags":[],"title":"Data Strcture","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Junhui Deng","Hua Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"Course Classification: Tsinghua University Computer Department Graduate Basic Theory Course\nLecturer：Junhui Deng, Hua Xu\nTarget Audience: All Graduate Students\nTeaching Time：1997 - Today\n","date":852048000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":852048000,"objectID":"f93308c8be1670e9b2dc795f64282a4a","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/talk/computational-geometry/","publishdate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/computational-geometry/","section":"talk","summary":"Tsinghua University Computer Department Graduate Basic Theory Course","tags":[],"title":"Computational Geometry","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Yuan Yuan","Hua Xu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6b7b52354494c1b60185acf84b1a8696","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/publication/a-new-dominance-relation-based-evolutionary-algorithm-for-many-objective-optimization/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/a-new-dominance-relation-based-evolutionary-algorithm-for-many-objective-optimization/","section":"publication","summary":"Many-objective optimization has posed a great challenge to the classical Pareto dominance-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). In this paper, an evolutionary algorithm based on a new dominance relation is proposed for many-objective optimization. The proposed evolutionary algorithm aims to enhance the convergence of the recently suggested nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III by exploiting the fitness evaluation scheme in the MOEA based on decomposition, but still inherit the strength of the former in diversity maintenance. In the proposed algorithm, the nondominated sorting scheme based on the introduced new dominance relation is employed to rank solutions in the environmental selection phase, ensuring both convergence and diversity. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a number of well-known benchmark problems having 3-15 objectives and compared against eight state-of-the-art algorithms. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can work well on almost all the test functions considered in this paper, and it is compared favorably with the other many-objective optimizers. Additionally, a parametric study is provided to investigate the influence of a key parameter in the proposed algorithm.","tags":[],"title":"A New Dominance Relation Based Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization","type":"publication"}]
